# Simple docking layout for React

*Work in progress*

Allows rearranging the layout by dragging and resizing views.

Sandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-docky-forked-s5hib

Examples:
 * [Simple](https://github.com/pcdv/react-docky/blob/main/example/src/App.tsx) (same as in sandbox but in TS)
 * [With undo](https://github.com/pcdv/react-docky/blob/main/example/src/App2.tsx)

*Todo*
 * Stack views on top of each other (tabbed view)
 * Drag tabbed group
 * Store splitter size in state
 * Skins / easy customization of look and feel
 * More tests and examples

*Maybe todo*
 * Maximize view?
 * Floating mode?
